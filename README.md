# cashApi

Simple Django API for a mobile app that I created for learning purposes. The code for a compatable Android app is available on my other repo.

Provides the following - 
  1. Login and authentication with Oauth2 tokens, gotten via Username + password, or via Social media authentication (tested google-oauth2 login)
  2. Method for getting current user details
  3. Method for uploading a base64 encoded image, and local storing per user
  
Todo: 1. a full image gallery, and document storage
      2. Deploy on AWS.   
      3. HTTPS, with Let's Encrypt (or simple DV) Certificates
      4. Maybe some OCR functionality and stuff also.
